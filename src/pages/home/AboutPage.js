      A free, easy to use, High-tech Augmentative/Alternative Communication tool.
    </p>
    <h3 className="about">What Does It Do?</h3>
    <p className="about">
      ...designed to help people with communication disabilities
      interact and express themselves more efficiently. Users can easily speak their
      mind while utlizing commonly used words, built-in and custom phrases,
      and manual text input. Word and phrases are organized into easily-navigable
      categories by default, but users are also free to create their own custom
      categories to make communication even easier.
    </p>
    <h3 className="about">Who Is It For?</h3>
    <p className="about">
      ...best suited for literate adults with adequate motor control.
      It can be used by people with congenital impairments such as aphasia, autism and
      cerebral palsy, as well as acquired conditions like ALS and Parkinson&#39;s
      disease. Of course, anybody can use SpeakEasy as a fun tool or as a means of
      gaining a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by those with communication
      disabilities.
    </p>
    <h3 className="about">Why?</h3>
    <p className="about">
      ...born out of the desire to drive the inclusion of disabled
      individuals in mainstream society and their ability to develop the
      skills required for independence. While Augmentative and Alternative Communication
      (AAC) technology has made incredible strides over the past 30 years, much
      of this technology is sorely lacking in terms of affordability and
      accessibility. We hope this free, open, easy-to-use app will serve as a
      solution.
